The entire current C2PA/Truepic/Sony infrastructure relies on monolithic trust architectures within a single device. 
A compromised TEE or a supply-chain attack breaks the entire chain. 
The proposed sectorized architecture with a physical data diode is the only known approach that realizes two-domain trust 
within a single device — one proprietary, one open-source-auditable — with cryptographically independent signature chains 
connected only by a hardware-enforced unidirectional channel.
